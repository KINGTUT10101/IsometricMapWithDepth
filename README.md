# Isometric Map With Depth
Demonstrates how to implement an isometric game where the tiles can reside at different height levels. Inspired by my ongoing [port](https://github.com/KINGTUT10101/LoveCytopia "port") of Cytopia to LOVE2D. A tutorial explaining how the project works can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/view/kingtuts-blog/articles/making-an-isometric-map-with-height "here").

### Features
- Supports almost any tile height/width, min/max height level, and height multiplier
- Can translate map positions to screen positions for rendering
- Can translate screen positions to map positions for determining the location of the mouse

### Controls
- Left click: raise tile
- Right click: lower tile
- R: reset map

### Notes
- This project uses the LOVE2D framework and Lua. If you want to edit the program, it's recommended that you look [here](https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started "here") first
- EXE and LOVE files are provided in the [releases](https://github.com/KINGTUT10101/IsometricMapWithDepth/releases "releases") section for your convenience
- Feel free to raise [issues](https://github.com/KINGTUT10101/IsometricMapWithDepth/issues "issues") if you find any problems
